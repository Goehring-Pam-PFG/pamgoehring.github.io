                <h2>Review</h2>
                <p>
                Over the holidays, Ned, an overprotective but loving dad and his family visit his daughter at Stanford,
                where he meets his biggest nightmare:
               her well-meaning but socially awkward Silicon Valley billionaire boyfriend, Laird .
               The straight-laced Ned thinks Laird, who has absolutely no filter, is a wildly inappropriate match for his daughter.
               The one-sided rivalry-and Ned's panic level-escalate when he finds himself increasingly out of step in the glamorous
               high-tech hub, and learns that Laird is about to pop the question.
